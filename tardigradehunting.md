## What are Tardigrades?

Tardigrades aka Water Bears or "Moss Piglets" (according to wikipedia though I've never heard it myself) are 8 legged **animals** with their own Phylum called `Tardigrada` which translates to "slow steppers". These animals are notable because they are extermely resellient to extreme conditions. 

More specifically they can withstand:

Condition | Value
:--- | :---
Gamma Rays | [5000Gy](https://doi.org/10.1080/09553000600972956)
Vaccum | At least 10 days ( _source needed_ )
_add more examples_ | coming soon

Immunity to these hostile enviroments is achieved through a process called "crypobiosis" in which the Tardigrades lose most of their moisture and become inactive.
